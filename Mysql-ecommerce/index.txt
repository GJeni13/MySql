Task:
    Create a database and tables to manage a simple e-commerce system. 
    The system should have three tables: customers, orders, and products.

Step 1: Create the Database
    -- Create the e-commerce database
    
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
USE ecommerce;

Step 2: Create the Tables 

    -- Create the customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each customer
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,         -- Customer's name
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- Customer's email address
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL        -- Customer's address
);

-- Create the products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each product
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,         -- Product's name
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,      -- Product's price
    description TEXT                    -- Product's description
);

-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    -- Unique identifier for each order
    customer_id INT,                      -- Reference to the customer who placed the order
    order_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Date the order was placed
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, -- Total amount of the order
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) -- Foreign key constraint
);

Step 3: Insert Sample Data
       1. -- Insert sample data into customers
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, address) VALUES 
('jeni', 'jeni@gmail.com', '1A,mainroad,Tirunelveli'),
('jebastin', 'jebaboy@gmail.com', '2B,Northstreet,Madurai'),
('Roslin', 'rose@gmail.com', '243,middlestreet,Coimbatore');

-- Retrive sample data

SELECT * FROM customers;
id  name         email                       address
1	jeni	    jeni@gmail.com	        1A,mainroad,Tirunelveli
2	jebastin	jebaboy@gmail.com	    2B,Northstreet,Madurai
3	Roslin	    rose@gmail.com	        243,middlestreet,Coimbatore

        2.-- Insert sample data into products
INSERT INTO products (name, price, description) VALUES 
('Product A', 30.00, 'Description for Product A'),
('Product B', 20.00, 'Description for Product B'),
('Product C', 50.00, 'Description for Product C');

-- Retrive sample data

SELECT * FROM products;
id  name        price   description
1	Product A	30.00	Description for Product A
2	Product B	20.00	Description for Product B
3	Product C	50.00	Description for Product C
			
            -- Insert sample data into orders
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total_amount) VALUES 
(1, 150.00), 
(2, 75.00),
(1, 200.00);

-- Retrive sample data

SELECT * FROM orders;
id  customer_id     order_date               total_amount
1	    1	        2024-10-08 13:29:01     	150.00
2	    2	        2024-10-08 13:29:01	        75.00
3	    1	        2024-10-08 13:29:01	        200.00

Step 4: Write the Queries

-- 1. Retrieve all customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days.

SELECT DISTINCT c.*
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;

id  name         email               address
1	jeni	    jeni@gmail.com	    1A,mainroad,Tirunelveli
2	jebastin	jebaboy@gmail.com	2B,Northstreet,Madurai

-- 2. Get the total amount of all orders placed by each customer.

SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id;

name    total_spent
jeni	    350.00
jebastin	75.00

-- 3. Update the price of Product C to 45.00.

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

UPDATE products
SET price = 45.00
WHERE name = 'Product C';

select * from products;

id  name        price       description
1	Product A	30.00	Description for Product A
2	Product B	20.00	Description for Product B
3	Product C	45.00	Description for Product C

-- 4. Add a new column discount to the products table.
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN discount DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0;

SELECT * FROM products;

id  name        price       description             discount
1	Product A	30.00	Description for Product A	0.00
2	Product B	20.00	Description for Product B	0.00
3	Product C	45.00	Description for Product C	0.00
				
 -- 5. Retrieve the top 3 products with the highest price.
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;

id  name        price       description             discount
3	Product C	45.00	Description for Product C	0.00
1	Product A	30.00	Description for Product A	0.00
2	Product B	20.00	Description for Product B	0.00
				
-- 6. Get the names of customers who have ordered Product A.
-- Create the order_items table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each order item
    order_id INT NOT NULL,             -- Reference to the order
    product_id INT NOT NULL,           -- Reference to the product
    quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,   -- Quantity of the product ordered
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id), -- Foreign key linking to orders
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) -- Foreign key linking to products
);
-- Insert sample data into order_items

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 1, 2), -- Order 1 includes 2 units of Product A
(2, 2, 1), -- Order 2 includes 1 unit of Product B
(3, 1, 1), -- Order 3 includes 1 unit of Product A


SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.name = 'Product A';
			
-- 7. Join the orders and customers tables to retrieve the customer's name and order date for each order.
SELECT c.name, o.order_date
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

name        order_date
jeni	    2024-10-08 13:36:02
jebastin	2024-10-08 13:36:02
jeni	    2024-10-08 13:36:02

-- 8. Retrieve the orders with a total amount greater than 150.00.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amount > 150.00;

id  customer_id  order_date              total_amount
3		NULL       2024-10-08 13:29:01	      200.00
6	    1	     2024-10-08 13:36:02	      200.00

-- 9. Normalize the database by creating a separate table for order items and updating the orders table.

    -- Drop the existing order_items table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS order_items;

-- Recreate the order_items table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

-- Insert sample data into order_items
INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 1, 2), -- Order 1 includes 2 units of Product A
(2, 2, 1), -- Order 2 includes 1 unit of Product B
(3, 1, 1), -- Order 3 includes 1 unit of Product A
(3, 3, 1); -- Order 3 includes 1 unit of Product C

-- 10. Retrieve the average total of all orders.

SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_total
FROM orders;

average_order_total
141.666667

Explanation of Queries:

    1. Retrieve customers with recent orders: Joins customers and orders to find distinct customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days.
    2. Total amount by customer: Sums the total amount spent by each customer.
    3. Update product price: Changes the price of Product C to 45.00.
    4. Add discount column: Adds a new column for discounts in the products table.
    5. Top 3 products: Retrieves the top three products based on price.
    6. Customers who ordered Product A: Finds the names of customers who ordered Product A through a join.
    7. Customer names and order dates: Retrieves names and order dates from the orders and customers tables.
    8. Orders greater than 150.00: Selects orders where the total amount exceeds 150.00.
    9. Normalize with order items: Creates a new order_items table to separate order details and update references.
   10. Average total of orders: Calculates the average total amount of all orders.

This structure and these queries should give you a solid foundation for managing an e-commerce system in MySQL.
